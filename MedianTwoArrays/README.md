Given two sorted arrays, a[] and b[], the task is to find the median of these sorted arrays, where N is the number of elements in the first array, and M is the number of elements in the second array. 

Example 1:
Input:
N = 5, M = 6 
arr[] = {1,2,3,4,5}
brr[] = {3,4,5,6,7,8}
Output: 4
Explanation: After merging two arrays, 
elements will be as 1 2 3 3 4 4 5 5 6 7 8
So, median is 4.
 

Example 2:
Input:
N = 2, M = 3 
arr[] = {1,2}
brr[] = {2,3,4}
Output: 2
Explanation: After merging two arrays, 
elements will be as 1 2 2 3 4. So, 
median is 2.
