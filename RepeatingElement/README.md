Given an array arr[] of N elements. All elements of the array are in the range of 1 to N. And all elements occur once except two numbers which occur twice. Find the two repeating numbers. 

Examples:

Input: arr = [4, 2, 4, 5, 2, 3, 1], N = 5
Output: 4 2
Explanation: The above array has n + 2 = 7 elements with all elements occurring once except 2 and 4 which occur twice. So the output should be 4 2.

Input: arr = [2, 1, 2, 1, 3], N = 3
Output: 1 2
Explanation: The above array has n + 2 = 5 elements with all elements occurring once except 1 and 2 which occur twice. So the output should be 1 2.
