                                                    Index of first Occurrence in Sorted
Given a sorted array arr[] with possibly duplicate elements, the task is to find indexes of the first and last occurrences of an element x in the given array. 

Examples: 

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 67, 123, 125}, x = 5
Output : First Occurrence = 2
              Last Occurrence = 5

Input : arr[] = {1, 3, 5, 5, 5, 5, 7, 123, 125 }, x = 7


Output : First Occurrence = 6
              Last Occurrence = 6
